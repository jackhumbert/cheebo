* Verification of starter garb will be done by Cheebo or Hunters (Rank 4) and above.
* Heralds choose the participants to act as the "monster". Participants will be as close to the challenger's rank/skill as feasible. The challenges should be fun, not impossible.

* Monster battles Rank 4 and above will be heralded by Cheebo exclusively (since I'm the one making the rewards).
