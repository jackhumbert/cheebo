### Overview
The goal of these ranks is a way to give players agency to "level up" and feel like they are progressing by rewarding:

* Attendance
* Presentation (of garb/armor)
* High quality equipment (to use/share)
* Combat skills development

(Note that until rank 7, duels must only be _fought_, not _won_.)
